A highly opinionated monorepo with libraries such as
1. React Bootstrap
2. Redux and Rematch
3. React Router
4. Lerna for monorepo
5. Webpack
6. npm
7. nvm

Items I considered but did not go with

2. Antd
3. buttermilk router
4. Having multiple repos
5. Parcel
6. yarn

Deployment strategy
1. netlify
2. heroku

How to run:
